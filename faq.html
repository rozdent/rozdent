        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>TMJ Disorder (or TMJ) is a misalignment of the upper and lower jaws. It is aggravated by stress and is often the result of chronic jaw clenching and teeth grinding.</p>
          <p><b>What are the signs?</b></p>
          <p>When the TMJ, located in front of the ear, is not working properly, it can cause muscle spasms, ear pain, neck pain and headaches. You may notice pain or hear a clicking/popping noise when you open your mouth or yawn.</p>
          <p><b>What can be done?</b></p>
          <p>Dental treatment involves the use of a splint or bite plate to move the lower jaw forward. An alternative is the use of functional appliances during orthodontic treatment to reposition the lower jaw to a pain-free position.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">How can I protect my children's teeth from cavities?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Dental sealant is a thin coating, (white, clear or lightly tinted) that is applied to the biting surfaces of back teeth to protect the deep grooves where cavities often begin. Sealants prevent cavities by providing a barrier that prevents acid-producing bacteria and plaque from setting into tiny crevices and causing decay.</p>
          <p><b>Save money!</b></p>
          <p>Less expensive than restorative work, sealants can be a real money-saver, too!</p>
          <p><b>Effortlessly!</b></p>
          <p>Application is relatively fast, requires no anesthetic and is painless. The benefits last for years!</p>

      <div class="panel panel-default"><a name="faq-snore"></a>
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">What can I do about snoring and sleep apnea?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>A great day begins with a good night's sleep. Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea are both breathing disorders that occur during sleep due to the narrowing or total closure of the airway. Consistent, loud, heavy snoring and obstructive sleep apnea may result in excessive daytime sleepiness and has been linked to medical disorders such as an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, heart attack, neurological disorder and stroke.</p>
          <p><b>Dental Appliance Therapy</b></p>
          <p>Dental appliances may be helpful in the treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. The appliance is a small plastic mouthpiece, like a mouthguard. By design, a dental appliance gently repositions the lower jaw forward enabling the air passage in the throat to become more open.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">What is Fluoride and how it affects development of cavities?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Fluorides are compounds derived from fluorine, a natural element. Fluoride is recognized for combining with tooth enamel to strengthen it and help prevent cavities. It also stops cavities by remineralizing tooth enamel after it has been attacked by the acids produced by the bacteria in dental plaque.</p>
					<p>Fluoride is most effective when it is added to drinking water. It acts both when teeth are forming and on the enamel surface after the teeth have come in. Water fluoridation is recommended by all organization promoting oral health. Even a very small concentration of fluoride can significantly benefit the dental health of infants and children at an age when cavities do the most damage.</p>
					<p><b>Fluoride toothpaste</b></p>
					<p>For children who lack access to fluoridated water, fluoride toothpaste is highly recommended. Some precautions are necessary when brushing, however. A small dab of toothpaste, about the size of a grain of rice, is enough for children under two, and the size of a small pea for children from two to six.</p>
					<p>Make sure your child doesn't swallow fluoride toothpaste. Toothpaste for children often tastes good. Young children who swallow too much toothpaste can develop slight dental fluorosis, so it's important to supervise children under six while they are brushing. The teeth of children under three should be brushed by an adult.</p>
					<p>Slight fluorosis produces white stains on the child's teeth, but is not dangerous. Fluorosis does not occur in adults.</p>
					<p><b>Fluoride supplements</b></p>
					<p>There are fluoride supplements for children at high risk of cavities and whose teeth do not get enough fluoride. Before prescribing them, your dentist will give your child a complete examination and evaluate the risk of cavities, and then determine the proper dose for your child's needs.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">What are impacted wisdom teeth?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Impacted wisdom teeth (or impacted third molars) are wisdom teeth which do not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the wisdom teeth do not have an open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth.</p>
